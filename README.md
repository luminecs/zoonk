# Zoonk

Zoonk will be a platform where you can learn anything through interactive courses. I’m building on what I did with Uneebee but restructuring everything from the ground up—so it made sense to start fresh with a new repository. Uneebee won’t be maintained anymore, but if you liked it, feel free to fork it.

The first version will focus on LLM-powered learning, but later, I’ll add tools for creating interactive courses, similar to how Uneebee worked. I’ll share more details in the coming weeks as I start working on this full-time in mid-February.

Expect the first release around summer 2025. Follow the repo or the project on social media to stay updated.
