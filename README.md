# Zoonk

Zoonk will be a platform where you can learn anything through interactive courses. I’m taking what I built with [Uneebee](https://github.com/zoonk/uneebee) and rebuilding it from the ground up, so it made sense to start fresh with a new repository. Uneebee won’t be maintained anymore, but you’re welcome to fork it if you found it useful.

The first version will focus on LLM-powered learning, with interactive course creation tools coming later—similar to what Uneebee offered. This new project will be open-sourced in Summer 2025. Follow this repository or Zoonk on social media for updates.
